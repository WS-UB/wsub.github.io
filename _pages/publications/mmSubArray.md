abstract: "The integration of satellite and terrestrial networks is crucial for achieving seamless global connectivity, especially in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, which offers substantial bandwidth for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we introduce mmSubArray, an innovative solution that leverages sub-band phased arrays to enable joint satellite-terrestrial operations. By utilizing mmWave technology, mmSubArray effectively overcomes challenges associated with high-frequency signal propagation, including atmospheric attenuation and alignment precision. This approach enhances link reliability, optimizes resource allocation, and offers scalable performance for both stationary and mobile users. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in network throughput and latency, paving the way for enhanced global connectivity and robust next-generation network architectures."
conclusion: "This paper presents mmSubArray: Array of Sub-band Phased Arrays, a novel solution utilizing commercial off-the-shelf phased arrays to bridge satellite-terrestrial connectivity."
